# MANAGEMENT WEB LAUNDRY with XAMPP

Hey everyone, this time my team and I succeeded in creating a website for laundry management using CRUD principles
- [x] Create
- [x] READ
- [x] Updates
- [x] DELETE
This website is still self-hosted so you need several tools such as:
1. xampp (incl : mysql, apache)
2. vscode (incl : PHP intellisense, php server, etc.)

how to run laundry web management
1. clone this repository
2. Save the file in `D:\XAMPP\htdocs`
What if you save it on disk C then `C:\XAMPP\htdocs`
3. then go to XAMPP and click "start" Apache and "start" MySQL.
4. After that click "Admin" on MySQL
5. Then change your phpmyadmin localhost link to `http://localhost/laundry`

the website can be run.
